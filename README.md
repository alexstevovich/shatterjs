----------

Decomposes JavaScript files into their four fundamental components: **shebang**, **header**, **body**, and **footer**. 

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/shatterjs)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shatterjs) [![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/shatterjs)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shatterjs) [![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/alexstevovich/shatterjs)](https://github.com/yourusername/shatterjs/blob/main/LICENSE) [![bundle size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/shatterjs)](https://bundlephobia.com/package/shatterjs)

## Features

-  Each component is an OOP object that can easily be worked with.
-  Header and Footer are subdivided further into comment blocks, comment lines or empty lines.

----------

## Warning
I have made the functionality as robust as I could currently foresee to accomplish the goals I had for this package. 

#### Please keep in mind:
- JavaScript document structure is complex, and it's likely I didn't consider all fringe cases and uses.
- The abstract nature of how documents are decomposed could lead to a rapidly evolving API that may not be compatible with current versions.  
- I will release a new major version for each breaking change, following a period of evaluation on the current `1.0.0` version.

**Note:** Use in production environments with caution due to potential structural changes in future major versions

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash

npm install shatterjs

```

Or with Yarn:

```bash

yarn add shatterjs

```

----------

## ðŸš€ Quick Start



```js
import { Doc } from 'shatterjs';

const source = `
#!/usr/bin/env node
// This is a header comment
/* Multi-line
   block comment */
const hello = 'world';
console.log(hello);
// Footer note
`;

const doc = new Doc();
doc.from(source);

console.log('Shebang:', doc.shebang.content);
console.log('Header:', doc.head.content);
console.log('Body:', doc.body.content);
console.log('Footer:', doc.footer.content); 
```

----------

## ðŸ§© Component Breakdown

### Shebang
Detects the shebang line (if present).

---

### Head
Captures decorative comments before code starts.


### Body
Framed from the start of valid code to the end of valid code.

--- 

### Footer
All content after the last line of valid code.

--- 

### InlineComment
Single-line comments (e.g., `// comment`).

--- 

### BlockComment
Block comments spanning multiple lines  `/* comment */`

--- 

### EmptyLine
A line filled only with whitespace or a single line break `\n`.

## Why ShatterJS?

I created `ShatterJS` for my licensing preamble package [**LawfulGood**](https://github.com/alexstevovich/lawfulgood) to identify whether a preamble already exists and where to insert a block of licensing code at the start of a document.

I modularized the functionality as I can see other use cases for this beyond script licensing.
